title: Week of 04 Oct
---

Most of this week in Software Engineering was a continuation of what we did last week. With the test coming up next Thursday, Professor Downing gave us more problems to do during class to prepare us for what will hopefully be similar ones on the exam. Although the solutions to these problems ended up being really short and simple, a few lines of code at most, arriving at the "correct" solution took some thought. Without some of the hints we were given, I'm not entirely sure if we would have gotten the answers, but hopefully with some studying, the exam will turn out okay.

On the bright side, I'm getting better at the quizzes. This may either be because I'm getting used to having quizzes or because the quizzes are more directly related to what we covered in class a few days before instead of recalling obscure facts from the readings. Even if I do the readings, remembering details is not my strong point, though maybe this means that I should be reading more critically. Either way, I'm glad that the readings are going to be tested on the exam.

We also just got our project 2 grades back, which turned out better than I expected. I am curious on what the feedback says, but we'll have to wait until tomorrow to get that back.

For the software tip of the week, [these slides](http://asmeurer.github.io/python3-presentation/python3-presentation.pdf) are an interesting read on cool features of Python 3 that aren't supported in Python 2.
